target_multimodality_diagnostic.py -- EXPLORATORY diagnostic, not the
formal §3.2 multi-modality procedure. §3.2 requires the clustering cut
threshold to be fixed on development targets before any test-cohort
target is examined; no such threshold has been pre-registered anywhere
in this project. Applying a threshold chosen after already knowing this
target is the problem case would defeat the point of pre-registering it.

This script instead reports cluster structure across a RANGE of cut
heights, so nothing is silently picked to produce a convenient answer.
If this exploratory look shows real multi-modal structure, the formal
§3.2 procedure still needs to run properly: threshold fixed on the
OTHER cohort targets first, applied to this one blind, before anything
here is treated as the paper's actual multi-modality result.

Reuses read_c1_coords() and extract_z() exactly as the main pipeline
does -- no reimplementation of coordinate reading or z-extraction.

Usage:
    python target_multimodality_diagnostic.py <target_name> <sample_dir> <dotbracket_string>
